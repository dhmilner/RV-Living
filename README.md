# RV-Living
This is going to be a journal/blog as we travel the country.

My husband, Harry and I, are getting ready to make a huge change in our lives. Harry retired last year after serving our country for 24 years in the United States Navy. He has traveled the world and peed in all the major oceans. Now we are getting ready to travel the United States of America as tourist and enjoy everything that he fought to protect for so many years. 

We have bought an RV and soon will have our house emptied and rented out for another family to enjoy. It is scary and exciting all at the same time. The prospect of Saturday mornings walking on a beach at sunrise or hiking the Redwoods Forest instead of mowing grass, trimming hedges, and all the other household maintenance, is a lifestyle change we are more than ready to jump on.
